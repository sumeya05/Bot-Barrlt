Description
Bot Battlr is a React-based web app that allows users to view, enlist, and manage an army of battle-ready bots. Users can browse a collection of bots fetched from a local API, add their favorites to a personal army, and remove or permanently discharge bots as needed.

Each bot displays key stats such as health, damage, armor, and class, with the option to reveal detailed information on demand. The app demonstrates clean component design, dynamic state management with React hooks, and interactive UI behavior.
